# react-native-ffmpeg (only for android at the moment)
This isn't truly a full expose of ffmpeg library to react native. That would be a very hard objective.
The idea here is very simple - ffmpeg can do a lot of things. Lets expose purpose built functions to react native.

## Getting started

`$ npm install react-native-ffmpeg --save`

### Mostly automatic installation

`$ react-native link react-native-ffmpeg`

## Usage
Check the ffmpeg_test_app.
